---

## Current Priorities (Next Focus)

### 2. **Testing Infrastructure Enhancement** ✅ SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED
**Current State**: Strong foundation with 75%+ coverage for internal packages

**✅ Completed**:
- Comprehensive unit tests for config, crypto, monitoring, schema packages
- Race condition testing and concurrent access verification
- Database utilities and metadata column testing
- Architecture validation and error handling testing
- **NEW**: Reliability features testing (circuit breakers, retry policies)
- **NEW**: Health check system testing with reliability integration
- **NEW**: Performance profiling system testing with benchmarks
- **NEW**: Security features testing (memory zeroing, constant-time ops)

**🔄 Still Needed**:
- **Integration Tests**: Real KMS provider testing (Vault, AWS KMS)
- **Generated Code Testing**: Verify `encx-gen` output correctness
- **End-to-End Testing**: Full crypto workflow validation

**Implementation Plan**:
```

│   ├── codegen/        # Code generation testing

└── benchmarks/         # Performance benchmarking
    ├── crypto_bench_test.go
    ├── codegen_bench_test.go
    └── memory_bench_test.go
```

### 3. **Code Quality & Maintainability** 🔧
**✅ Improvements Made**:
- Removed deprecated processor package (367 lines eliminated)
- Fixed race conditions and thread safety issues
- Improved error handling consistency
- Better architectural separation (internal vs public APIs)

**🔄 Large Files Still Need Refactoring**:
- `crypto.go` (371 lines) - Consider further splitting
- `internal/codegen/templates.go` (354 lines) - Split by template type
- Large generated files in examples/ could be optimized

**🔄 Remaining Issues**:
- Some build failures in examples/ and providers/
- Integration test setup needed
- Performance benchmarking infrastructure missing

### 3.5. **Custom Serializer Implementation** ⚡
**Current Problem**: Multiple serializer options (JSON, GOB, Basic) introduce unnecessary complexity and overhead for single-field encryption operations.

**Proposed Solution**: Replace with single, purpose-built binary serializer optimized for ENCX's specific use case.

**Benefits**:
- **Performance**: 3-5x faster serialization, 60-80% smaller output
- **Deterministic**: Same input always produces identical bytes (critical for searchable encryption)
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time guarantees for supported types
- **Simplicity**: Removes ~400 lines of serializer selection code

**Implementation Plan** (8 hours total):

#### Phase 1: Create Custom Serializer (2 hours)
```go
// internal/serialization/compact.go - Explicit type handling
func Serialize(value any) ([]byte, error) {
    switch v := value.(type) {
    case string:     // [4-byte length][UTF-8 bytes]
    case int64:      // [8 bytes little-endian]
    case bool:       // [1 byte: 0x00=false, 0x01=true]
    case time.Time:  // [8 bytes Unix nano little-endian]
    case []byte:     // [4-byte length][raw bytes]
    // ... explicit handling for all primitive types
    default:
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("unsupported type: %T", value)
    }
}
```

#### Phase 2: Remove Serializer Selection (2 hours)
- Remove `default_serializer` and `serializers:` from `encx.yaml`
- Remove `SerializerType` enum and factory methods
- **Preserve**: `GenerationOptions` infrastructure for future options
- Update `validateGenerationOptions()` to reject `serializer` key

#### Phase 3: Update Code Generation (2 hours)
- Hardcode `compact.Serialize()` in templates
- Remove serializer-related template data
- **Keep**: `GenerationOptions` processing for future features

#### Phase 4: Package Cleanup (1 hour)
- Delete: `json.go`, `gob.go`, `basic.go`, `types.go`, `interface.go`
- Remove `Serializer` interface entirely
- Update all imports to use compact functions

#### Phase 5: Testing & Documentation (1 hour)
- Comprehensive tests for all supported types
- Update examples and documentation
- Performance benchmarks vs. old serializers

**Files to Remove**:
- `internal/serialization/json.go`
- `internal/serialization/gob.go`
- `internal/serialization/basic.go`
- `internal/serialization/types.go`
- `internal/serialization/interface.go`

**Future Extensibility Preserved**:
- `//encx:options key=value` comment parsing infrastructure
- `GenerationOptions` field for new options like:
  - `//encx:options table_name=custom_users`
  - `//encx:options key_rotation=daily`
  - `//encx:options compliance=pci_dss`

### 4. **Developer Experience** 👨‍💻
**Missing Features**:
- **IDE Integration**: VSCode settings for build tags and linting
- **Better Error Messages**: Add context and suggestions to validation errors
- **Development Documentation**: Troubleshooting guide for common build issues
- **Git Hooks**: Pre-commit validation and formatting
