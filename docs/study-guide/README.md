# Computer Architecture & Low-Level Optimization Study Guide for ENCX

## 🔐 **About the ENCX Project**

**ENCX** is an enterprise-grade Go library for **field-level database encryption** with **code generation capabilities**. It provides transparent encryption/decryption of sensitive database fields while maintaining high performance and security.

### **Core Architecture:**
```
ENCX Library Architecture:
├── Field-Level Encryption    # Encrypt individual database columns
├── Code Generation Engine    # Auto-generate crypto structs from tags
├── Key Management System     # KMS integration (AWS KMS, Vault)
├── Serialization Layer       # Compact binary serialization
├── Production Features       # Monitoring, health checks, profiling
└── Security Infrastructure   # Memory protection, side-channel defense
```

### **Key Technical Challenges:**
1. **Performance:** Encrypt/decrypt thousands of fields per second with minimal overhead
2. **Security:** Prevent timing attacks, side-channel leaks, memory forensics
3. **Scalability:** Handle concurrent operations with circuit breakers and retry logic
4. **Reliability:** Production-grade monitoring, health checks, and observability

### **Why Low-Level Understanding Matters:**
- **Constant-time operations** prevent cryptographic timing attacks
- **Memory management** protects against forensic key recovery
- **Cache-friendly algorithms** maximize encryption throughput
- **Hardware acceleration** (AES-NI) provides 10-40x performance gains
- **Concurrent programming** enables high-throughput crypto operations

**Real-world usage:** ENCX encrypts PII fields like SSNs, credit cards, and medical records in production databases while maintaining application performance.
